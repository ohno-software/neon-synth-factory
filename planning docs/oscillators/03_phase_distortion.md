# Neon Oscillator Type: Phase Distortion (PD)

## Overview
Inspired by the **Casio CZ-101**, Phase Distortion uses a non-linear reading of a sine wave's phase to create resonant-like sweeps without a traditional filter.

## Features
- **Resonance Simulation:** Creates high-harmonic peaks using phase warping.
- **CZ-Style Shapes:** "Resonant Saw", "Resonant Square", "Double Sine".

## Core Parameters (Card Grid)
- **DCW (Digitally Controlled Wave):** Controls the amount of phase distortion (acts like a filter cutoff).
- **Shape Select:** Access to the 8 classic CZ waveform families.
- **Resonance:** Adjusts the intensity of the simulated resonant peak.
- **Phase Offset:** Shifts the start point of the distortion.
- **Detune:** Subtle frequency offset for thickening.

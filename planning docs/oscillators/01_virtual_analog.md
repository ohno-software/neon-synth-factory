# Neon Oscillator Type: Virtual Analog (VA)

## Overview
The Virtual Analog oscillator replicates the classic wave shapes of hardware subtractive synthesizers using mathematically generated vectors.

## Waveforms
- **Sine:** Pure fundamental, perfect for sub-bass.
- **Saw:** Rich in harmonics, the staple for leads and pads.
- **Square/Pulse:** Hollow character, with adjustable Pulse Width.
- **Triangle:** Smooth harmonic profile.

## Core Parameters (Card Grid)
- **Shape:** Morph between classic shapes.
- **Pulse Width:** For Square/Pulse waves.
- **Sync:** Hard sync to an internal master clock.
- **Phase:** Initial start phase of the cycle.
- **Tune/Fine:** Coarse and fine pitch control.
- **Drift:** Subtle pitch instability for "analog" feel.

# Neon Oscillator Type: Noise and Glitch

## 1. Noise Source
Essential for percussion, textural grit, and breathy tones.

### Noise Types:
- **White:** Equal intensity across all frequencies. Aggressive, bright.
- **Pink:** 3dB per octave roll-off. More natural, "organic" noise.
- **Blue:** +3dB per octave. High-pitched, crystalline hiss.
- **Crackled:** Randomized digital glitches and bit-crushing style artifacts.

## 2. Parameter Cards
- **Type:** (Binary Toggle) Switches between White, Pink, Blue, and Crackle.
- **Color:** (Linear) Spectral bias or filtering of the noise.
- **Density:** (Linear) For crackle, determines the frequency of events.
- **Level:** (Linear) Output Volume.

## Visual Representation (Top 2/3)
- **Visualization:** A granular "particle cloud" that dances to the noise density or a high-speed real-time FFT spectrum analyzer view in the Oscillator Cyan color.

# Neon Filter Type: Specialty and Lo-Fi

## Overview
Unique "Neon" brand processors that combine traditional filtering with digital destruction and unique spectral manipulation.

## Filter Models

### 1. Bit-Filter
A low-pass filter integrated with a sample-rate reducer and bit-crusher.
- **Character:** Gritty, aliased, retro-digital.

### 2. Spectral Mask
A filter that removes specific bands based on a selectable pattern (Pulse, Saw, Random).
- **Character:** Sharp, rhythmic, unpredictable.

### 3. Neon Glow (Phaser/Filter Hybrid)
A multi-stage all-pass network that creates shifting相位 cancellation.
- **Character:** Liquid, sweeping, deep.

## Parameter Cards
- **Bits:** (Linear) Resolution reduction (1-16 bits).
- **S-Rate:** (Linear) Frequency quantization.
- **Mask Pattern:** (Toggle) Choose the spectral masking shape.
- **Stages:** (Toggle) Number of poles or stages (2, 4, 8, 12).
- **Sweep:** (Linear) The center point of the phaser/glow effect.

## Visual Representation (Top 2/3)
- **Digital Grid:** For Bit-Filter, the display shows a pixelated version of the waveform or frequency response.
- **Animated Pattern:** For mask/glow, shows "scanning" bars or wavy lines indicating phase shifts.
- **Color:** Transitioning from Filter Teal (`0xff00ffaa`) to Neon Orange (`0xffffaa00`) for "hot" or destructive settings.

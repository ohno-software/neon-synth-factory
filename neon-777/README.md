# Neon 777

The Neon 777 is a dual-oscillator FM synthesizer built on the high-performance Neon engine. It features two carrier-modulator FM oscillators with ratio-based frequency control, allowing for a wide range of metallic, glass, and aggressive electronic sounds.

## Architecture
- **Dual FM Oscillators**: Each oscillator is a sine-mod-sine FM pair.
- **Ratio-based FM**: Choose musical ratios for harmonious FM or non-integers for bell-like tones.
- **Sub Oscillator & Noise**: Add beef and grit to your FM patches.
- **Dual Ladder Filters**: Flexible 12/24dB LP/HP/BP filters.
- **16 Voice Polyphony**: With high-efficiency C++ DSP.
- **Deep Modulation**: 4-slot Mod Matrix plus 16-slot Control Matrix.
- **Studio FX**: Chorus, Phaser, Delay, and Reverb.

## FM Parameters
- **Waveform (Ratio)**: Select the frequency ratio of the modulator relative to the carrier (0.5x to 16x).
- **FM Knob**: Adjust the modulation index (depth of FM). 0.0 is a pure sine, 1.0 is aggressive FM.
- **Octave**: Standard pitch shifting for the carrier.
- **Unison**: 1 to 4 voices with programmable spread.

## Technical Specifications

### Waveform Selection Guide
- **Saw waves**: Bright, harmonic - good for leads, pads, strings
- **Square waves**: Hollow, punchy - good for basses, brass, leads
- **Triangle waves**: Smooth, mellow - good for flutes, horns, soft leads
- **Supersaw (unison)**: Wide, chorus-like - good for pads, leads

### Filter Settings
- **24dB slope**: Darker, more resonant - good for basses, brass
- **12dB slope**: Brighter, smoother - good for pads, strings

### Envelope Settings
- **Fast attack (0-50ms)**: Percussive sounds - leads, plucks
- **Slow attack (500-2000ms)**: Atmospheric sounds - pads, ambient
- **Short decay (0-300ms)**: Plucked sounds - guitar, harp
- **Long decay/release (1000ms+)**: Sustained sounds - pads, strings

### LFO Settings
- **Slow (0.2-2Hz)**: Vibrato, tremolo, filter modulation
- **Fast (5-10Hz)**: Rhythmic effects, wobble bass

## Implementation Notes
1. Each preset should be sonically distinct and musically useful
2. GM standard categories provide a framework for sound design
3. Parameter values should be optimized for the neon-jr engine
4. Consider using existing recipes from factory-docs as starting points
5. Test each preset in context to ensure it sounds good

## File Output
- 128 .neon files in `Documents/NeonSynth/NeonJr/Banks/Factory/`
- Each file: `patch_N.neon` where N is the slot number (1-128)
- JSON format with "name" and "parameters" keys
